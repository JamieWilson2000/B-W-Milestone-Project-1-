                <p>While death and taxes may still be the trump cards in the game of certainty, the inevitability of a tempting upgrade to your favourite music production software can’t come far behind. For many years, Steinberg have been very consistent on this front, with annual upgrades to Cubase released towards the year end. Cubase 11 — in Pro, Artist and Elements versions — is therefore now with us.<br>
                <br>
                These regular annual upgrade cycles bring out different responses in users. Those happy with their current version can, of course, choose to stick but, when presented with a long list of improvements and new features, the temptation to twist can be high. So, just what are Steinberg adding in Cubase 11 that might entice existing users to upgrade, or tempt potential new users to take the plunge?<br>
                <br></p>

  <!--Second Section -->

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6 cubheading third">
          <p> The current DAW/sequencer marketplace includes many excellent choices, and Cubase is undoubtedly one of the ‘giants’ amongst this product group, with a long history, a large user base, and a comprehensive feature set. While v11 brings all sorts of worthwhile new developments, if you are part of that large user‑base and Cubase helps put food on your table, you can breathe easy; moving from any recent (10 or 10.5, for example) version to Cubase 11 is a smooth and painless transition.</p>
               <p>While there is truth in the old adage that if it sounds right, it is right, a visual representation of your audio can offer all sorts of helpful insights and it's with Cubase 11’s new SuperVision plug‑in that provides an excellent starting point in that regard.<br>
    <br>
    SuperVision is a single plug‑in, which can be placed as an insert anywhere it’s required to visualise your audio signals, but is actually an assemblage of modules that the user can configure and customise. <br>
    <br>
    The 18 available modules fall into a number of categories: Signal, Spectral Domain, Phase, Spatial Domain, Waveform and Other. Many of these are relatively straightforward, such as the Level module within the Signal category, or the Spectrum Bar (a frequency‑based histogram) within the Spectral Domain category. However, the range of options is impressive and will require many hours of exploring.</p>

              <p>Frequency 2 is an upgrade of an EQ introduced in version 9.This eight-band design was already good, with band-specific stereo, mid/side and left/right options, easy-to-use node editing, band auto listen, band-specific linear phase mode and keyboard scale. <br>
    <br>
    In Frequency 2, Cubase Pro users now get dynamic EQ with individual external side chain on all eight bands. This mode is available for peak and shelving filter shapes, and selecting the dynamic option simply switches the existing curve you have to dynamic mode. You then open the single band view to adjust the controls. These include threshold, ratio, attack and release. You also get a gain offset (Start) and between this and the main filter gain you can define quite accurate dynamic filtering behaviour. Frequency 2 does a great job of cutting unwanted frequencies momentarily, and this would be a typical use.<br>
