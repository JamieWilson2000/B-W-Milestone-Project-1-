                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p>One of the biggest concerns that put people off of entering into the world of music technology is that 
                        they haven't a big powerful computer, or the money to invest in one. In actual fact this is a very common
                        mis-conception. Many of the PC's sold today, off the shelf, are capable of running all of the digital
                        audio workstations. The specs of nearly all of todays most updated DAWs (digital audio workstation) 
                        actually require nothing overly special! A quad-core processor (preferred), 8gb Ram (very common), 
                        an SSD drive (becoming the normal nowadays), and if possible, a dedicated graphics card (again nothing
                        out of the ordinary!). Your sound will be handled by your Audio Interface but again when starting off,
                        the on-board soundcards can work ok when used with an ASIO driver. Most of the DAW's of today have 
                        a limited trial period so if in doubt, download one, have a play for a couple of weeks and you'll 
                        soon know if your PC is starting to struggle!!
                    </p>
                    <p>A preference that most music producers have is for a multi screen setup, normally one screen for your 
                        arrangement page, and another for your mixer / rack page. Although you will see this in nearly every
                    studio picture or film, this is not a necessity. All DAW's come as a one screen application and work 
                    perfectly well on one screen. As your expertise grows, then sure, invest in another screen but certainly 
                don't be worrying about it at this stage!  </p>

                                <p>So you have the computer sorted but what to run on it? All producers now have their favorite DAW, Digital Audio Workstation,
                                    and as with every other aspect of putting together a home studio, its all about trying products out and seeing which fit your

                                    FL Studio</a>, film and tv music producers can favour <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/cubase/" target="_blank">Cubase</a>, 
                                    whilst those into experimenting with creating new sounds and textures seem to gravitate towards <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/"
                                    target="_blank">Ableton</a>. The list goes on and on, and as always there is a DAW to suit every budget. FL Studio requires a
                                    one off payment for life, Cockos Reaper have a license for $60 for approximately two version upgrades which is an excellent 
                                    deal, the price goes up for other DAW's and requires an upgrade fee for each major update which again is optional.

                                <p>There are many free options out there too so be sure to check the internet for free workstations (not cracked versions though!!),
                                    CakeWalk by Bandlab is 100% free and only a few years ago would have set you back a few hundred bucks. If in doubt in making 
                                your decision, consult social media. Every DAW has a dedicated online presence of fellow users who are more than happy to aid and 
                            entice you into their world. Nearly all of the paid DAW's offer a 30 day trial period so the option is there to take them all for a spin"</p>

                                <p>These are considered to be one of the most important elements in your home studio. Costs range from a modest price
                                    (€50 - €100) all the way up into the thousands! Of course, one element to take into consideration is the room itself.
                                    Its pointless spending €1500 on a set of excellent studio monitors and placing them in a room with no acoustic
                                    treatment on the walls at all. Sure, the power might be there, and to your ears they might sound good, but you won't get
                                    a clear representation of how your mix will translate on other systems and environments.  Experts would advise that
                                    a good rule of thumb would be to treat your room first, acoustic panels on the walls, bass traps in the corners, soft
                                    floor coverings, all to catch those pesky bouncing frequencies, and then re-evaluate what's left of the budget 
                                    and purchase the best you can afford with the balance. You can achieve more with a cheap set of monitors and a well 
                                    treated room than you can with an expensive set and clean reflective walls! <br>

                                <p>Other factors you need to consider are what type and size of speaker. Do you need passive speakers (where the 
                                    audio will be handled by a mixing desk and send the signal out to un-powered speakers) or active speakers (that 
                                    take the signal direct from the interface and process the sound direct.) The size of speaker can be down to preferance 
                                    and you might be tempted to think the larger the better but if your monitors are too loud for the room you're working 
                                    in then this could distort the overall sound quality and in essence, your judgement whilst mixing.  </p>

            <div class="w3-container">
                <p>So how does the whole process work? Well, in short, the computer reads MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) notes and 
                    translates the information into an audible sound. This is the job of your Audio Interface. A basic interface will handle 
                    translating data into sound and will probably have a midi in/out/thru connection to recieve messages from external hardware, ie
                     synths etc. Moving up from that the interface will do all of the above plus it might now have a XLR input for the use of analog 
                     microphones or electro-acoustic instruments. On the back there will likely be stereo out ports for connecting to reference 
                     monitors and moving up from that, they will feature maybe two outputs for connecting two sets of reference monitors. 
                </p>
                <p>As with every aspect of setting up a home studio, it all comes down to your requirements. A singer/songwriter will likely 
                    manage with a two input / two output interface. This gives the artist an input for a guitar/piano and an input for his vocal,
                 perfect! A band however will maybe suit an eight input / two output interface. So think about what your artistic preferences
                 are, what will you be looking to create and choose appropriately.  </p>

                                <p>Daw's are great for working "inside the box" but sometimes you need something a little extra in the pot to make the track that 
                                    little bit special. Alongside and working within the software are programs called VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins. 
                                    These come in the form of virtual instruments, audio effects, MIDI effects, video players, all designed to add to your 
                                    arsenal of musical weapons. There are literally hundreds of thousands of these programs, ranging from free to thousands of pounds, 
                                    some are in-valuable, some are completely useless. Because they're created by third party software houses, compatability can be 
                                    troublesome at times. You may find that firing up a Reverb plug-in can slow down the program or cause clipping in the audio for 
                                    no apparent reason, it's trial and error. However, all DAWS come with their own bank of plug-ins which run seamlessly within 
                                    their own environment so choosing a VST is an option rather than a necessity.

                                <p>Microphones are another investment you might be interested in making. As always, you start at a budget range and run through into 
                                    the thousands. There are various types of mics as explained <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/types-of-microphones-and-how-to-use-them"
                                    target="_blank">here</a> by our friends at Music Radar, and again it's a matter of sitting down and thinking what your needs are. 
                                    The most famous of dynamic microphones would be the <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm58" target="_blank">
                                    Shure SM58</a>. This is used worldwide on every stage, even in the Whitehouse so I think it's safe to say, it's a pretty good place
                                to start! </p>
